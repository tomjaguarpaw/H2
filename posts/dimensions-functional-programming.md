# Dimensions of functional programming

*Work in progress*

* expression-oriented
* purity/referential transparency/lack of order effects (free of time)
  * value semantics/no object identity (free of place)
* anonymous functions
* closures/capturing local environment
* sum types and pattern matching
* tail recursion

See also Gabriella Gonzalez's "The End of History For Programming"::

*    expressions over statements
*    pure functions over side effects
*    algebraic datatypes over objects
*    recursion over loops
