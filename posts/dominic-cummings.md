# Some notes about Dominic Cummings

* it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors should hire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not going through

* it's about getting physical, spatial training data for our biological neural networks
* without this the data our neural networks are trained on are the words of others, i.e. their attempts to make persuasive arguments
* *BUT* the most important things we would like to model are complex systems
  * can we actually model them at all?
  * maybe language and metaphor *are* the best tools we have
* to develop not "gut feel" but the *right* kind of gut feel, i.e. gut feel based on having an intrinsic understanding of the system rather than gut feel based on not wanting to let your drinking buddy down
* I believe that we can learn to reason about things without understanding them!
  * By developing intuition
  * But it's important to develop the *correct* intuition
  * So we don't fall for fallacies, the supernatural, etc.
* How can we unlock the reasoning ability of thousands of people
* who are currently stuck regarding reasoning about large datasets because they can't program?
* A lot of Victor's stuff is really ambitious.
    * A lot of these ideas are really, really hard
    * What's the MVP?
    * Or alternatively, what's the 2% of the work that gets 98% of the benefit?
* I'm much more excited by the idea of checklists than Bret Victor's stuff
* Victor is clearly a visual thinker, but what about people with other thinking styles?
* One reason Victor's stuff hasn't come to pass is because the market for consumer applications is far larger (1000x?) than tools
