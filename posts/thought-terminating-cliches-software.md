# [Thought terminating cliches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9) in software

* "Use the right tool for the job"
* "You can write FORTRAN/Perl in any language"
* "You can get the job done in any language"
* "Engineering is all about trade-offs"

  > 'It doesn't take any depth of experience to say "oh, it's a
  > tradeoff, there are no good or bad techniques, only tools in
  > your toolbox". It sounds wise. But often it's plain wrong.'
