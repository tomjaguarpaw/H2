# Exploratory programming

> There is a general but fallacious impression that dynamically typed
languages like Lisp are more appropriate for prototyping because it is
"easy" to modify Lisp programs. The reason this impression is false is
that serious prototypes can be large and complex programs, and if one
changes the representation of data in one part of the prototype it can
be a long, error-prone, and labor intensive process to trace all the
consequences of such changes when using a dynamically typed language.
