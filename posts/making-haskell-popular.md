# Making Haskell popular

There was an interested thread on Reddit, "[What is your opinion on how
to make Haskell more
popular?](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cublk4/what_is_your_opinion_on_how_to_make_haskell_more/)".  Here are some of the ideas that I found interesting

* [Write simpler code](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cublk4/what_is_your_opinion_on_how_to_make_haskell_more/exuilcz/)

* [Iron Law of Monadic
  Misunderstanding](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cublk4/what_is_your_opinion_on_how_to_make_haskell_more/exujcza/):
  every time someone says "It's just the names that are confusing!
  Just change the name to something simple," they betray that they
  don't actually understand monads, and that the name they choose
  would reinforce their confusion.

* [Ship working
  software](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cublk4/what_is_your_opinion_on_how_to_make_haskell_more/exuuiv0/).
  Demonstrate that with Haskell you can consistently do so on time and
  under budget. Once you've done that, show that that software is more
  maintainable and you can evolve it more quickly and reliably than
  software written in other languages.  How do you do that? You keep
  things simple.
