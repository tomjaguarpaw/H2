# Critique of OOP

At some point I'll get round to writing a critique of OOP, but in the
meantime here and some interesting comments I found on Hacker News
with arguably inaccurate, but to me helpful, descriptions

* OOP is open recursion and its only use is GUIs

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20321185>

* Most people just want namespaces (and variables to come with their
  own namespaces)

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20324685>

* OOP is for GUIs

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20323838>

* Stepanov's objection

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20323173>

* Hickey's objections (i.e. his talks)

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20321022>

* OOP is an expensive disater that must end

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20323499>

* Deep class hierarchies worked well for developing widget trees and
  not much else

  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20322354>

* [The actual problem is] the implicit mutability and lack of actual
  type safety
