# Correcting Haskell myths

WIP

There are many myths about Haskell floating around.  Here is the
truth.  (Work in progress)

## Lenses are not a crutch to get around the poor record system

## Monads are not a hack to get around purity

## Extensions are compatible with each other

(I haven't checked this 100% but I've never come across or heard about
a significant incompatibility)

## A pure language can have effects

## Haskellers don't literally believe "if it compiles it works"

The origin seems to be unrelated to Haskell.  See some early
references.  Some appear to be tongue in cheek.
