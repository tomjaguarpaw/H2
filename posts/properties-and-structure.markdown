# Properties and Structure

A research question

In Haskell we can statically force "structure" on values.  An `Int` is
requried to support `negate`.  But we can't statically force
"properties" on values.  We can't, for example, require at compile
time two `Int`s to be equal.

Do these notions of "structure" and "properties" correspond to those
for categories, explained in [Stuff, structure, and
properties](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stuff,+structure,+property)?
(Forget about the "stuff" for now).  What, then, is the underlying
category?
