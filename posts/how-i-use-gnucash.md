# How I use Gnucash

I use Gnucash.  It does the job but often when I upgrade I encounter a
new bug.  These are the ones I've encountered, and their fixes:

* [delete and backspace don't work in
  gnucash](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnucash/+bug/1318877)

* [gnucash 3.3 crashes upon keypress in
  transaction](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnucash/+bug/1802994)

(Interestingly both bugs related to GTK)

## Dark mode

See the [GTK `settings.ini`
configuration](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/GTK3#Themes) and then
also do Edit -> Preferences -> Settings -> Register -> Disable "Use
Gnucash built-in color theme"
