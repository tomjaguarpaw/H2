# Learning Monads

This quotation from a mathematician nicely supports the phenomenon of the
[monad turorial
fallacy](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/).

> This common and unfortunate fact of the lack of an adequate presentation of
basic ideas and motivations of almost any mathematical theory is, probably,
due to the binary nature of mathematical perception: either you have no
inkling of an idea or, once you have understood it, this very idea appears
so embarrassingly obvious that you feel reluctant to say it aloud; moreover,
once your mind switches from the state of darkness to the light, all memory
of the dark state is erased and it becomes impossible to conceive the
existence of another mind for which the idea appears nonobvious.

-- Mikhail Gromov, as quoted in M. Berger, [Encounter with a
   geometer](http://www.ams.org/notices/200003/fea-berger.pdf).  II, Notices
   Amer.  Math.  Soc.  47 (2000), no.  3, 326--340.

I first discoved this quotation on [a Math Overflow
answer](https://mathoverflow.net/a/15631).
