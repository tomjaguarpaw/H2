# Bret Victor talks

*Very* rough notes on Bret Victor talks that I may write up some day.

## Media for Thinking the Unthinkable

"Thoughts we cannot think": amazing idea

* more general idea than Sapir-Whorf?

* tools *in general* shape thought

* language is just one tool

* 13:44 Jerome Bruner Interactive/Visual/Symbolic is nice

* See also [Bidirectional
  Programming](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/icmt-2009-slides.pdf)

## Inventing on Principle

* I agree with following a principle

* I'm not sure I agree with making it a moral issue

* I agree with the idea of tightening feedback loops

* reminds me of [constraint-based graphic
  design](https://www.anishathalye.com/2019/12/12/constraint-based-graphic-design/)

* I'm impressed by the demo but extremely skeptical about how well it
  generalises

* can you really do everything you might want to do by having
  familiarity with only a small number of concepts and techniques?

* 36:00:
    * We need to be able to see the behaviour of the system ... be
      able to adjust the system and see the response"
    * "We need multiple representations of the system"

## Future of Programming

* He's faked up an overhead projector! (And dressed as if he's from the 60s)

## Seeing spaces

A large part of it is communication: making sure everyone is on the same page

## [worrydream.com Climate Change](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

This one is *amazing* and I'm totally on board with that
