# Sugar considered harmful

-- for the health of your programming language

* Not just talking about syntactic sugar

* Sugar makes it easier to swallow a bitter pill.

* Sugar is anything that makes an immediate-term difficulty more
  palatable at the expense of long term codebase health.

* Sugar can give you a boost of energy when you need to get over a
  hill but it's not actually a suitable ingredient for building or
  repairing your body.

* Once you start eating sugar, the meal is over.
