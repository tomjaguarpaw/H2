# Sugar considered harmful

-- for the health of your programming language

* Not just talking about syntactic sugar

* Sugar makes it easier to swallow a bitter pill.

* Sugar is anything that makes an immediate-term difficulty more
  palatable at the expense of long term codebase health.

* Sugar can give you a boost of energy when you need to get over a
  hill but it's not actually a suitable ingredient for building or
  repairing your body.

* Once you start eating sugar, the meal is over.

  > try to keep data structured as long as possible and push operations
  that lose information towards the edges of your system. Information
  is fundamentally easier to destroy than to (re)create!

  This is not about sugar but has the same underlying dynamics.  Sugar
  is fundamentally easier to apply than to remove!
