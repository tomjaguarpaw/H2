# How I use MacOS

* By default Ctrl-Space switches keyboard layout. I disable it: <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/423971/disable-controlspace-keyboard-shortcut/423974#423974>

* If your tilde (~) key has become switched for plus-minus (Â±) then in
  the keyboard settings, choose "change keyboard type" and choose ANSI
  keyboard (not ISO).

* iTerm2 to send Alt properly: Preferences -> Profiles -> Default ->
  Keys -> Left Option Key -> Esc+

* Fix the iTerm2 flashing white line bug:

* Rebind Caps Lock to Enter:

  ```
  hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping": [{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc": 0x700000039,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst": 0x700000058}]}'
  ```

* Show dock instantly

  ```
  defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0 && killall Dock
  ```

* Disable drag lock: Accessibility -> Pointer Control -> Trackpad
  Options -> Enable Dragging -> Without Drag Lock

  But how to release drag instantly?  No one knows.

* Weird mouse wheel scroll acceleration.  This doesn't seem to work:

  ```
  defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -1
  ```

  Haven't tried this: <https://github.com/davekeck/DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration>

* Chrome undo close tab: Command-Shift-T or File -> Undo Close Tab

* iTerm2 dim inactive background windows: iTerm2 -> Preferences ->
  Appearances -> Dimming -> Dim Inactive Background Windows
