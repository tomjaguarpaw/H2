## Tests for Opaleye

I need a lot more tests along these lines

## Writing version 1 of Opaleye

Version 1 will be basically version 0 with some renamings and
tidyings.  The only big change is that I want to use pure wires rather
than expression arrows, as described [under "Expression Arrows" in the
`DESIGN`
document](https://github.com/karamaan/karamaan-opaleye/blob/dev/DESIGN.md#expression-arrows).

## An nice-looking Opaleye website

I don't see why Opaleye should not have at least as nice a website as
[Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/).

## A typesafe Latex API with no risks of injection bugs
