Q: Keys switched

A: Hold Fn down and press ESC about 4 seconds, if Capslocked backlight can flash 3 times, it means reset succeed.

If FN and left WIN swapped,hold left WIN down, and press ESC about 4
seconds, capslocked backlight will flash 3 times.


 The most common solution is to reset the keyboard settings by holding
 down the Fn + Esc keys for 3-4 seconds until the Caps Lock light
 flashes 3 times. This should reset the keyboard and restore the
 Windows key functionality.
