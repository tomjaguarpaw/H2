# Extended set theory

Extended set theory seems to be a very complicated mess simply to put tuples
with column names on some sort of solid foundation.  Why a structural set
theory is not enough is unclear, although structural set theory certainly
did not exist when Childs came up with his theory (some time in the 1970s).
